## **The Hyrule Castle**

The Hyrule Castle is a small CLI RPG game based on the Zelda universe.
It is a school project presentend as the end-project of the first three weeks of onboarding.

## Game set-up

Install npm dependencies with npm install, compile the project with npm run build, and launch the hyrule_castle.js file from the build/main folder.
